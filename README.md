# TypeScript 25+5 Timer App

This repository houses a TypeScript-based 25+5 Timer App, a productivity tool designed to help users manage their work or study sessions effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The app allows users to set customizable timers for both work and break intervals, enhancing focus and productivity.

- **Visual and Auditory Alerts:** Receive visual cues and an audible alarm when the work session is completed, signaling the start of the break. Similarly, another alert signals the end of the break, prompting you to resume your work or study session.
- **Progressive Work-Break Cycles:** Implement the popular 25+5 Pomodoro Technique for enhanced productivity with regular breaks.
